        <h4>What is SQL ?</h4><br>
        <div>
            <p>SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a powerful and widely used programming language
                designed for managing and manipulating relational database management systems (RDBMS). It provides a
                standard way to interact with and extract data from databases, making it an essential tool for working
                with structured data.</p>
            <div class='liststyle'>
                <ul>

                    <li>SQL is a domain-specific language for managing relational databases.</li>

                    <li>It allows users to create, update, and query databases to retrieve, modify, and delete data.
                    </li>

                    <li>SQL is used to define the structure of databases (data definition language or DDL) and
                        manipulate the data within them (data manipulation language or DML).</li>

            <h4>Why SQL ?</h4>

            <div class='liststyle'>
                <ul>
                    <li>SQL is essential for working with relational databases, which are used in a wide range of
                        applications and industries.</li>

                    <li>It provides a consistent and efficient way to retrieve and manipulate data, ensuring data
                        integrity and security.</li>

                    <li>SQL is the standard language for querying and managing data in most relational database
                        management systems (RDBMS), making it highly portable across different systems.</li>

                </ul>
            </div><br>

            <h4>History of SQL :</h4>


            <p>SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a programming language designed for managing data
                held in a relational database management system (RDBMS). It is one of the most widely used and popular
                programming languages in the world, and is used by millions of people every day to store, retrieve, and
                manipulate data.</p>

            <p>SQL was first developed in the early 1970s by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce at IBM. It was
                originally called SEQUEL, which stood for Structured English Query Language. SEQUEL was designed to be a
                simple and intuitive way to access and manipulate data stored in IBM's System R relational database
                management system (RDBMS).</p>

            <h6>SQL has evolved significantly over the years. Some of the key milestones in the evolution of SQL
                include:</h6>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>1979:</b> Relational Software, Inc. (now Oracle) introduces the first commercially available
                        implementation of SQL.</li>
                    <li><b>1986:</b> The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) publishes the first official SQL
                        standard, known as SQL-86.</li>
                    <li><b>1989:</b> SQL-89 is published, adding support for transactions and triggers.</li>
                    <li><b>1992:</b> SQL-92 is published, a major update to the SQL standard that includes support for
                        subqueries, outer joins, and window functions.</li>
                    <li><b>1999:</b> SQL-99 is published, adding support for object-relational databases, XML data, and
                        user-defined data types.</li>
                    <li><b>2003:</b> SQL-2003 is published, adding support for recursive queries, window functions, and
                        common table expressions.</li>
                    <li><b>2011:</b> SQL:2011 is published, the most recent version of the SQL standard.</li>

                <ul>

                    <li>SQL is in high demand in the job market. Many organizations require SQL skills for data-related
                        positions, including data analysts, database administrators, and data engineers.</li>

                    <li>It's a valuable skill for anyone who needs to work with structured data, whether for business
                        analysis, reporting, or application development.</li>

                    <li>Learning SQL can open up opportunities to work with a wide variety of databases, such as MySQL,
                        PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and more.</li>
                    <li>It is used in Data Analysis, Web Development, Business Intelligence, E-commerce, Healthcare, Finance and many more.
